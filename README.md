A simple classic-style text adventure game written in D.

This is a very simple classic text adventure game written in D as something of an experiment.  The game text itself,
such as the room descriptions etc., are copyright 2019 while the rest of the code is licensed under the GPLv2.  If these
sorts of games interest you, feel free to take a look at the code.  More features and polish will be added as the code and game
continue to be worked on.
